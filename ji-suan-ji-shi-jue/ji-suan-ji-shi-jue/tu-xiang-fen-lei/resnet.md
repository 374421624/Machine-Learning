231n中对ResNet的评价：

* **ResNet**. [Residual Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) developed by Kaiming He et al. was the winner of ILSVRC 2015. It features special _skip connections_ and a heavy use of [batch normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). The architecture is also missing fully connected layers at the end of the network. The reader is also referred to Kaiming’s presentation \([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGLj-uKT1w), [slides](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/ilsvrc15/ilsvrc2015_deep_residual_learning_kaiminghe.pdf)\), and some [recent experiments](https://github.com/gcr/torch-residual-networks) that reproduce these networks in Torch. ResNets are currently by far state of the art Convolutional Neural Network models and are the default choice for using ConvNets in practice \(as of May 10, 2016\). In particular, also see more recent developments that tweak the original architecture from [Kaiming He et al. Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027) \(published March 2016\).
