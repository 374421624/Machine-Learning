# GoogLeNet

231n中对GoogLeNet的评价：

* **GoogLeNet**. The ILSVRC 2014 winner was a Convolutional Network from [Szegedy et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) from Google. Its main contribution was the development of an _Inception Module_ that dramatically reduced the number of parameters in the network \(4M, compared to AlexNet with 60M\). Additionally, this paper uses Average Pooling instead of Fully Connected layers at the top of the ConvNet, eliminating a large amount of parameters that do not seem to matter much. There are also several followup versions to the GoogLeNet, most recently [Inception-v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261).
